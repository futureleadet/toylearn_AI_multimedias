"Generate an image of the attached apartment building's walls with tangerine groves and rice paddies growing alongside, yielding abundant crops. 

In the vacant space of the apartment on the far left of this image, install a waterfall so that water flows and cascades down to the floor. 

Create an advertisement featuring this image with the concept of “a world that doesn't exist in this world” and include the text 'SKY GARDEN RESIDENCES: Live the Future of Sustainable Luxury'."
